# Neural Net with learning Based on Evolutionary strategies

A very simple 2 layered fully connected neural network is implemented here and trained on XOR gate data ( 2D binary input and 1D binary output having XOR relationship). 

Instead of commonly used backpropagation its trained using evolutionary strategies. This is more of a 'hello world' kind of program.
