# Neural Network trained with Evolutionary strategies

A very simple two layered fully connected neural network is implemented here. It is trained on two dimensional binary inputs and one dimensional outputs of a XOR gate.  
Instead of commonly used backpropagation, evolutionary strategies are instead used for training. This is more of a 'hello world' kind of program, but for the application of evolutionary algorithms on a neural network
